# system-install.el

This is a simple package which provides handy wrappers around pacman / apt / dnf and enables
installation / removal / upgrade of packages using a unified, completing read interface.

Package lists are cached in a json file which defaults to =~/.emacs.d/system-package-cache.json=, but can be customized by setting the value of ~system-install-package-cache-file~.

The json file will be refreshed at a default interval of 7 days, which can be changed by setting =system-install-package-cache-refresh-days=.

Commands:

#+begin_src

(system-install-upgrade)
(system-install-update)
(system-install-package-info)
(system-install-remove-package)
(system-install-upgrade-package)
